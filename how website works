Q. How website works?

Client needs google.com
    ->  you will go to url on browser
    ->  You will go googles web server
    ->  web server gets the information that this is utu with 
        ip address and some other information
    ->  Actually client will send the get request.
    ->  so the request will go to web server and it will see that
        in which folder this google.com page is
    ->  web server is nothing but a computer
    ->  web server will also see security aspects like this ip is
        banned or not and etc. like logged in or not.
    ->  And then server returns the respones with html css js code as
        a bundle to the web browser. You can see that bundle code by 
        doing right click and go to inspect or view page source.
    ->
